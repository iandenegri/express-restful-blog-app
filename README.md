# Basic Blog Application
The purpose of this application is to practice developing a Web Application using a framework outside of my comfort zone.

Additionally, as I program primarily in Python, this is also an exercise to help get me more comfortable in learning and writing code in different languages and to get me out of the habit of just using the same methods and functions that I always have used.

# Set up
- Have node installed.
- Run mongodb and open localhost:27017 as this will be your database
- `npm install`
- `node app.js`
